sixfeetup.customfolderalert Installation
----------------------------------------

To install sixfeetup.customfolderalert into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* When you're reading this you have probably already run 
  ``easy_install sixfeetup.customfolderalert``. Find out how to install setuptools
  (and EasyInstall) here:
  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

* If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it 
  via::

    python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance

into your Zope instance.

* Create a file called ``sixfeetup.customfolderalert-configure.zcml`` in the
  ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
  should only contain this::

    <include package="sixfeetup.customfolderalert" />

.. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts


Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``sixfeetup.customfolderalert`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [instance]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        sixfeetup.customfolderalert

    zcml =
        sixfeetup.customfolderalert
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
